        ### Automatically post and re-post Kijiji ads to remain on the front page
        ![kijijilogo](autokijiji.jpg)
        
        **To successfully sell items or services on Kijiji, keep your posts on the front page as often as possible!**  
          
        Though there are paid options for keeping ads at the top, I wanted a method of doing so that was both free and easy.
        
        Enter **_autokijiji_** - a command-line tool (or stand-alone Python program) to post and re-post your Kijiji ads.
        
        > **The main function of _autokijiji_ is not simply to _post_ ads but to _repost_ ads.**
        
        By _deleting_ a current ad and _reposting it_, it will turn up near the front of the listing.
        
        **_autokijiji_** can be executed on a timer (eg. cron) to re-post your ads daily or weekly.  
        
        This is a personal project to moderate my buying-and-reselling-of-camping-equipment, and has been successful thus far!

        ## Install
        ### Manually
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/reubengazer/Auto-Kijiji.git
        cd Auto-Kijiji
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        Then, setup your config.yaml file (more on this below):
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --init
        ```
        
        **Dependencies: selenium, python-dotenv, pathlib, numpy**  
        Run `pip install selenium python-dotenv pathlib numpy` to manually install all the dependencies
        
        ## Configure
        
        ### config.yaml
        
        *autokijiji* needs to point to a config.yaml file which contains:
        
        - base kijiji urls for posting ads and viewing your active ads (included by default)
        - the path to your browser driver
        - [optional] your phone number (optional to post with ad, your Kijiji profile doesn't save the phone-number)
        - [optional] your preferred browser in which to deploy auto_kijiji
        
        To download the driver for your browser:
        
        - for **Mozilla** you can [download the driver here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) 
        - for **Chrome** you can [download the driver here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) 
        
        **Easiest way to define config.yaml**: simply run autokijiji with --init:
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --init
        ```
        
        It will by default save a _config.yaml_ file in the install directory.  
        
        You may edit this file at any time :
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --update_config
        ```
        
        Optionally, you may create your own config anywhere and pass it in as an argument (--config) on the fly:
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --config myconfig.yaml --ads ./some-item-to-sell
        ```
        
        The config.yaml file looks like this:
        
        ```yaml
        kijiji_post_ad_url : https://www.kijiji.ca/p-admarkt-post-ad.html?
        kijiji_my_ads_url : https://www.kijiji.ca/m-my-ads/active
        phone_number : 1234567890
        preferred_browser : firefox
        browser_driver_path : /path/to/your/browser/driver
        ```
        Currently supported browsers are 'firefox' and 'chrome'.
        
        ## Example: Let's Sell Some Hiking Boots!
        
        ### Logging In to Kijiji
        Auto-Kijiji assumes you are already logged in via your browser, and grabs your browser profile to login to your Kijiji account.   
        Auto-Kijiji currently does not perform any auth-like procedures but for checking your User's browser profile (.default file).
        
        ### Storing Your Ad Content
        For Auto-Kijiji to work properly, each ad must be represented by a DIRECTORY.
        Each of these directories (ads) must contain 1 .json file containing your ad information and any number of images, like this:  
        
        ```bash
        # Example directory of some boots I'm selling
        /scarpa_hiking_boots/
            hikingboots.json
            mybootphoto.JPG
        ```  
        
        Your ad content is contained in the .json file and must look like this:
        
        ```json
        {
          "category_id":"286",
          "title": "A cool pair of hiking boots!",
          "price": "100",
          "description": "A pair of boots that has been worn once. \nGreat grip on the bottom and waterproof.",
          "tags": ["hiking boots", "camping equipment", "camping attire", "hiking equipment"],
          "image_fps": ["mybootphoto.JPG"]
        }
        ```
        
        Image types currently supported are .jpg/.jpeg/.JPG and .png.  
        
        ## Try it out
        Assuming you've set the config.yaml file (if not, see above) let's post the example ad contained in the repo (hiking boots):  
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --ads ./example_ad_hiking_boots 
        ```
        
        This will open up a browser in real-time in front of you.  
        
        Let's run it in the background:
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --ads ./example_ad_hiking_boots --background
        ```
        
        **Uploading Multiple Ads**: Simply pass in multiple arguments for --ad_dirs:
        
        ```bash
        autokijiji --ads ./example_ad_hiking_boots ./vintage_campstove ./fishing_rods
        ```
        
        ## Command-Line Arguments
        
        --init -> initialize config.yaml  
        --ads -> directory or directories of your ads to post  
        --delete_first -> whether to delete your ad before re-posting it (default: True)  
        --browser -> the browser you'd like to deploy ('firefox' or 'chrome')  
        --background -> whether to run this in the background (default: True)  
        --config -> manually submit a config.yaml file that isn't setup from --init  
        --version, -v -> print your current version of *auto_kijiji*
